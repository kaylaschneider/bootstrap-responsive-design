                            <p class="bio"> From humble beginnings in 1972 (the first year of JMU football), the MRDs have quickly moved to the fast track of college bands in America. The 475-members are primarily non-music majors and represent practically every department on our campus and every major JMU has to offer. The band is one of our institution’s largest and most visible organizations with an active performance schedule both on campus and in the surrounding community. The MRDs perform at all home football games, travel to away games to support the Dukes, and make several annual appearances at community events such as marching band contests and parades around Virginia and the Mid-Atlantic region. </p>
                            <p class="bio">Among their many awards and performances, the MRD’s have performed at NFL games in Pittsburgh, Baltimore, and Washington. In 1983 they were the featured halftime show for the NFC title game between Washington and Dallas. They have been performers for Walt Disney Productions and several times have been the premier band for the Richmond Christmas Parade. In 1988 and 1991, they were the featured exhibition at the Bands of America Grand National Championships.</p>
                            <p class="bio">In 1994 the John Philip Sousa Foundation named the Dukes recipients of the Sudler Trophy, known as the "Heisman Trophy" of college marching bands. In 1997 and 2001, they were featured in the inaugural parades for Presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush. In 2002, 2006, 2010, 2014, 2019, and 2022 they performed at the inauguration ceremonies for Virginia Governors Mark Warner, Tim Kaine, Bob McDonnell, Terry McAuliffe, Ralph Northam, and Glenn Youngkin.</p>
                            <p class="bio">The band has established a strong tradition as ambassadors of the university and community. They have taken six good will tours abroad. Their first tour to Europe was in 1997, performing for the closing ceremonies of the 700th anniversary of the Grimaldi Family in Monaco. In December 2000 the Dukes performed at a New Year's celebration in Athens before an audience of more than 500,000. In December of 2003 they made their first tour of Ireland and were the featured band for the New Year’s celebration in Dublin, returning to Dublin for their second New Year’s performance in December of 2006. In 2010 the MRDs took their fifth trip abroad with a trip to London and Paris, and were featured in the 25th Anniversary London New Year's Day Parade. 2013 marked the band's most recent tour of Italy, participating in the 2014 Rome New Year's Festival and performing at the Vatican. They will return for the program's 50th Anniversary tour of Italy in December 2022.</p>
                            <p class="bio">The band has been an integral part of the JMU Football experience both on campus and around the region. During the 2004 season, the Marching Royal Dukes traveled with the JMU Football team to perform at the NCAA Division 1-AA National Championship game in Chattanooga, TN, where the Dukes took home their first national title in school history. In 2016 the Dukes brought home their second National Championship title from Frisco, TX and returned in 2017 and 2019 for JMU's third and fourth National Championship games. The MRD’s have made four appearances in the Macy's Thanksiving Day Parade: 2001, 2008, 2013, 2018.</p>
                            <p class="bio"><em>The band is supported by the Yamaha Corporation, Zildjian Cymbals, Demoulin Uniforms, and McCormicks Enterprises, Inc., and has been used in the international advertising campaigns for those firms.</em></p>

The revamped band has become an integral part to home basketball games with their energetic music and wild antics. Under the direction of Mrs. Amy Birdsong, the band has risen to popularity throughout the country after repeated post-season appearances by both basketball teams. In just five short years, the band has attended post-season play in Virginia, Maryland, North Carolina, Ohio, and Texas. The goal of the band is to entertain the crowds wherever they may be while continually supporting the Dukes basketball teams.</p>
                    <p><em>The band is open to all students at JMU that play brass, saxophone, drumset, bass, or guitar.</em></p>

                        <li><p><strong>SCHEDULE:</strong> The group rehearses for 30 minutes prior to each game. The ensemble convenes at the beginning of the basketball season.</p></li>
